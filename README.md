# BookFinder

## Description
This application utilizes a Google Books API to allow a user to search for their favorite books and make a list of books they would like to read. The application runs on an Apollo Server and we use GraphQL queries and mutations in order to fetch and modify data. The challenge required that we sorted through existing code in order to set up the correct front and back-end specifications.
